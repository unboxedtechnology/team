Unboxed Team Norms
==============

This repo serves as a place to record norms that we agree to abide by as a team. This readme contains some base principles. Other files may be created to capture other principles or processes. To propose a new norm or a change to an existing norm, fork or branch this repo, make your change, then create a pull request. Discussion around the idea can happen on the pull request.

The Art of Software
-------------

Our primary responsibility as a team is the development of software that makes us proud. It is easy to get caught up in the flurry of activity surrounding the process of software development, and as a result spend very little time or thought into what we are actually developing. To help us stay focused on our primary responsibility as a team, one of our norms is to spend a minimum of **4 hours** per day actually developing software. Our daily march has both a minimum and a maximum. It is important for us to maintain balance and a healthy focus in normal times so that in times of crisis we will have the energy and capacity to respond well. For that reason, we consider **6 hours** per day the most a developer should spend on focused development tasks in a normal day.

It is impossible to define concisely and completely exactly which activities constitute software development, but it is something that, for the most part, is understood intuitively by a developer. It is easier to describe the things that **generally** do not constitute software development:

* Meetings
* Reading and writing emails
* Shooting nerf guns
* Reading/learning activities
* Hanging out at the coffee bar

Most of those things are necessary parts of our job, and they relate to software development, but we **should not** habitually spend more than half of an 8 hour work day on those things.

Team Values
-----------
As an Unboxed developer, I will:

* Pay attention to detail, take pride my work, and treat my work as my legacy and craft. My final product will be impressive.
* **Participate & Contribute.**
 > 1 code review a week
 > 
 > Present in rotating dev talks
* Produce things I am proud of, and speak up when my environment forces me to do otherwise.
* **Respect** other peoples time.  When I seek help I will first seek to understand, then organize my thoughts.  Once I receive help I will seek to understand.
 > Value asynchronous communication over synchronous. The development of quality software requires periods of intense focus. Any time you initiate or insist on synchronous communication, you are disrupting someone else's productivity. Asynchronous communication requires more discipline, but it makes us more productive as a team.
 > 
 > Avoid meetings that do not have as their purpose making a decision. If the point of a meeting is to share information, that information can generally be shared in a written form that can be reviewed more quickly than a one hour meeting.
* 5 minutes or less.  It will take 5 minutes or less for someone to setup my project.
* **Learn** new things, be open to feedback and give back.  
* I want to get better at what I do and I understand it's an active process.  
* Play by the Sandbox rules & Help keep the house clean. 
  > Technical debt is a natural byproduct of software development. Sometimes it's an idea that made sense at the time, but some time later no longer makes sense. Sometimes it's corners that were cut in an effort to meet a deadline. Regardless of the cause, technical debt is one of the biggest detractors from forward progress. Make the reduction of technical debt part of your regular workload. If you encounter a mess, it's almost always worth taking the time to clean it up before moving on.
* Keep Liquid Planner / Trello  tasks up to date.  High level development tasks will be tracked in L.P., and keeping them updated will help our team keep track of project statuses, as well as the current bandwidth of each team member.
* Strive to be one fad behind. We don't want to be so far behind the rest of the world that we feel handcuffed by legacy tools and software, but we also don't want to be wasting our limited time and resources on tools, software and practices that are unproven and often have no future. As professional software developers it is important that we remain aware of those and continually have an attitude of exploration and discovery. As a team it is important that we don't infuse unproven technologies into our stack that burn us later.




Thanks CRUGlobal for setting us down a rad path!
