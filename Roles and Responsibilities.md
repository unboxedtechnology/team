# Good ole R&R

## Overview

This document is designed to outline roles and responsibilities for team members.  There are 3 different levels of "roles": Architect, Technical lead,  Developer.  Dont read too much in the names for things because Architects can be Developers, technical leads can be developers.  These are just contextual roles that may change depending on the day of the week.
Hello everyone wanted to send out a quick email to make sure we are aligned on roles for the project and expectations for collaboration.  Not a fan of lengthy emails so I’m meeting with everyone individually as well.  I plan to go over these with each of you but wanted to give you all time to digest so when we meet you can ask questions.  


### Architect
Primary role on a project is a thought partner and approver. When they are not doing those things they are helping to deliver stories or future planing/thinking.  They expect to be informed/approved on the following:

**Informed**:

1. **Plan** for the sprint.  Once an engineering team is done planning the architect will want to go over the plan with the leads on the projects.  Architects do this so they can understand dependancies between the teams, plan for support and check-ins, and to make sure we are managing scope (only working on mission critical things).
2. **Risk** If you get to the point where you feel something is becoming increasingly risky it's time to pull in some support.  Architects can help leads come up with a plan of action / communication.
3. **Deviation**  from a plan.  If a plan has been approved or discussed with an architect and for whatever reason you/the team deviates from the plan, let the Architect know why.

**Approver**:
2. API – Any database change or API that is going to be created. Architect is the approver for these things.  Sometimes the architect may provide you with a path and ask you to follow it, other times the architect may act as a thought partner.     
3. C#/JS/SASS - Any library that gets added to the project.  Architect needs to discuss why we need it and how to get the rest of the team up to speed on how to use it.
4. JS -  If you are adding new module/major service to the site (e.g. Users,Accounts, Recommendations, etc) they need to be a part of the design.  Why?  To make sure the apprpriate level of thought has been put into the changes you are introducing.  Questions they might ask:  What is the landing page? How are you planning on doing show/edit/list?  What state is being shared? Will there be any resolves? etc.  
5. CSS – Style guide element or a change that will effect everything, a new modal design, a new loading pattern, etc.  
6. Architecture/Refactoring efforts  – If an issue arises that needs to be reworked, before activating make sure you get approval to do the change.


When in doubt just ask.
