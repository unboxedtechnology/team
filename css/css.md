We follow the guideliness outlined in [Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS](https://smacss.com/book/)

  Remember these rules:

  1. We prefer classes pretty much over everything else (elements, ids, attributes, etc)
  2. We don't go beyond 3 levels of selectors.  If you think you need 4 bring in a second opinion
  3. Keep your selectors as minimal as possible (makes it easier to overrride)
  4. Be consistent.  Don't be using random font-sizes, padding, margin.  
  5. Don't override framework styles, extend them.
  6. Keep elements in natural order.  If you have button A B C , we expect them to be in that dom order.  
  7. Lean on the side of less.  Try not to over style and only use framework classes.
