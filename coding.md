# Coding Guidelines

## Overview

This document's purpose is to define the core principles we code by.  

## General Principles

### B.S Rule

We actively clean and fix code.  If we enter an area that needs some love we clean up as much as we can given time.  If we see things that violate our standards we fix them.  From naming, tabs vs spacing, jshint errors, duplicate code, etc.  Whatever the case we always try to fix the things we see and document those that we must ignore.

 
### Code review early and often

Why?

1. Enforce & Re-incorce team principles

2. Architectural changes. Its important to have someone look validate your design early and to challenge the solution.  We do this to help validate the design before its too late.  You dont have to always fix everything, but it's important that you at least acknowledge and accept any flaws in the design.

3. Teaching.  Code changes fast, and an excelent way to learn is through application & others.  Code reviews are an excelent time to learn something new, or learn a different way of doing or thinking.

### Responsibility

We make responsible decisions. We build software that businesses depend on so we need to be diligent with our designs & tools.  We want to stay on top of technology but we need to be mindful when adpoting the new and shiny.  


We are small so we do no re-invent wheels.  We look to parnter with well maintained open source technologies and when applicable we give back to the open source community.


### We produce clean code

We strive to write code that is simple and easy to consume.  By doing this it allows for us to document less.  We error on the side of brevity.  Our functions are atomic and mission oriented.  We comment when nessecary and we avoid the superflous.


### Principles we belive in

1. (S.O.L.I.D)[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_%28object-oriented_design%29]
2. (KISS)[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle]
3. (DRY)[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself]
