###Planned
If you are planning to be OOO:
 1. Pick your dates. 
 1. Talk with your IP & Manager to make sure there is nothing critical going on. 
 1. Once you get the approval its now time to put it on your calendar as OOO
 1. Put it in LP in the 2015 Vacations / PTO Bucket (see link below).  
 1. At a reasonable time before you leave (I do it the week before).  Send a reminder / warning email to everyone you work with including your manager reminding everyone you will be OOO soon and that if they need you before to go ahead and get with you now.
 1. Day before you leave send an email letting everyone know if you are contactable and if not who is going to be answering questions on your behalf
 1. Enjoy your OOO time.

###Unplanned
Something comes up and you have to be OOO
 1. Email / Call your manager.  Give them as much details as necessary and give them a rough estimate of when to expect you back.  Let them know who needs to be contacted about you being out. 
 1. If you can email your team please do it.  Let them know you are OOO.

###Weird Hours
This isn’t a vacation but it needs to be communicated effectively.  Lets say you want / need to work some odd hours for the week/weeks.  Send an email to your team stating your intent and let them know if they are going to need you during those hours to do their best to schedule in advance. 


###3rd Party Expectation
I’m not OOO but someone on my team is
 1. Team || LeadDev ||  Manager – If you know someone is OOO and have not seen a team announcement in chat:  Send out a message to Dev Scrum example is below.  Let the team know that <Insert Name> is OOO today.
